<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>&sect; 1: Using this Tutorial</H2>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3>Navigation</H3>

<P>You have entered this document one of four ways: </P>

<OL>
<LI><B>If you have three frames in your window,</B> then the frame you
are reading is called the &quot;main&quot; frame and contains the tutorial
text. The frame on the left, the &quot;navigator&quot; frame, can be used
to move around the tutorial. The bottom frame is the <I>WebTerm</I> frame
and it's an actual terminal to a Unix computer. You can use <I>WebTerm</I>
to try out the commands as they are discussed, even if you are working
on this tutorial from a non Unix computer. </LI>

<P>In order to make it easier to use this document, you should make the
Netscape window as large as possible. On the X Window System, this is done
by pressing the square button in the upper right hand corner of the window.
Depending on the type of computer you are working on, other actions, such
as dragging the button in the lower right hand corner, may be necessary.
Keep experimenting until you find what works. </P>

<LI><B>If you selected &quot;Launch the tutorial in its full form In two
windows&quot;</B>, you should have two frames in this window and a second
window containing the java program WebTerm. It is recommended that you
expand the window you are reading as large as possible without hiding Webterm.
Try moving your windows around to see if there is any space left, or if
WebTerm is covered. If you need to change the window sizes, try dragging
your mouse on the sides of your windows to make them larger or smaller.
</LI>

<P>Now look at your page. The frame you are reading from is called the
&quot;main&quot; frame and contains the tutorial text. The frame to the
left is called the &quot;navigator&quot; frame and can be used to move
around the document. The second window is called &quot;WebTerm&quot; and
is a Unix terminal that can be used to try out commands as they are discussed.
If you cannot find the &quot;WebTerm&quot; window, go back to the introduction
and try selecting "In a Single Window".
</P>

<LI><B>If you selected &quot;Read the the tutorial text Using frames and
JavaScript&quot;</B> You should have two frames in your window. The frame
you are reading from is called the &quot;main&quot; frame and contains
the tutorial text. The frame to the left is called the &quot;navigator&quot;
frame and can be used to move around the document. You can ignore all references
to WebTerm. If you are working with the X Window System, you may wish to
try out the commands by using your left mouse button to &quot;cut&quot;
them from the text and your middle mouse button to &quot;paste&quot; them
to your terminal window. </LI>

<LI><B>If you have only one frame</B>, you can ignore references to the
&quot;navigator&quot; frame and to WebTerm. If you are working an X window,
you may wish to try out the commands by using your left mouse button to
&quot;cut&quot; them from the text and your middle mouse button to &quot;paste&quot;
them to your terminal window. </LI>
</OL>

<P>It is recommended that you do NOT use the Netscape <I>Forward</I> and
<I>Back</I> buttons while using this tutorial. Their use, as well as the
use of the <I>Go</I> button may lead to confusion. </P>

<P>There are two ways to maneuver in this document. The navigator frame
on the left contains the table of contents for the current section of the
document. You can click on any link in it and go directly to that section.
The main frame will frequently contain links to related information, and
you can follow these links as well. Occasionally, one of these links will
lead you to information contained in another set of documents. If this
occurs, the information will be brought up in a separate window, and possibly
in a different color. You can close this window (hold down your mouse over
&quot;<I>File</I>&quot; and select &quot;<I>Close</I>&quot;) and return
to the tutorial when you are done with the text. If you merely &quot;iconify&quot;
the window (on an X station &quot;click&quot; your mouse on the small dot
near the upper right hand corner of the window), you will have to re-expand
the window when you wish to read another outside link. </P>

<P>In addition to the ordinary links in the main frame, most documents
contain several buttons. The buttons labeled &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot;
take you to the next and previous pages respectively. &quot;Next&quot;
and &quot;Previous&quot; in this case refer to the logical flow of the
tutorial, like a book, in contrast to jumping between former and latter
pages as occurs with a Web browser like Netscape. The &quot;Up&quot; button
in a tutorial takes you back to the introductory section, while the &quot;Contents&quot;
button takes you to the Table Of Contents. Notice that only the &quot;Next&quot;
and &quot;Contents&quot; buttons appear in the Table Of Contents. </P>

<P>If you have been restraining yourself, it's time to go out now and try
some of the navigation tools. Make sure to dress warmly and come back soon
to this page. </P>

<H3>Using WebTerm</H3>

<P>To activate <I>WebTerm,</I> &quot;click&quot; your mouse on the <I>Connect</I>
button in the <I>WebTerm</I> window. The <I>WebTerm</I> screen should then
show several informational messages, and finally respond with the prompt:
</P>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1><TT>login:</TT> </FONT></P>
</UL>

<P>If you are a registered user, you have been given a userid and password
and should enter them now. To login, keep your cursor over the <I>WebTerm</I>
frame and type your userid. Then press the <I>return</I> or <I>enter</I>
key. If the computer asks you to change your password, please do as instructed
(and don't take it personally). If you are not a registered user, you can
try loging in with the userid <I>guest</I> and the password <I>demo</I>.
(Note, the host computer limits guest accounts in what they can do, and
you are expected to watch your manners.) </P>

<P>Note, you must type in your userid and commands <I>exactly</I> as they
appear, the exception being that you can add additional spaces if one is
there already. In particular, Unix is case sensitive and this means upper
and lower case letters are considered different. </P>

<P>You should now have the prompt: </P>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1><TT>Password:</TT> </FONT></P>
</UL>

<P>Go ahead and type in your password followed by the return key. Once
you are logged in, you can try the commands as they are described in the
text. For many commands, you will have the option of typing the command
or &quot;clicking&quot; a button and allowing the tutorial to copy it to
Webterm for you. Where user-specific information is required, you will
have to type the command in yourself. Here is an example of a button </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>&gt;<FONT SIZE=-1> echo 'Hello'</FONT></TT><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT><APPLET codebase="bin" code="RegistryButton.class" 
     height=22 width=85><PARAM name="register" value="Unix Tutorial WebTerm"><PARAM name="label" value="echo 'Hello'"><PARAM name="command" value="send"><PARAM name="text" value="echo 'Hello'\r\n"></APPLET></P>
</UL>

<P>Note, in this and in most of the tutorials, the lefthand-most greater-than
symbol <TT>&gt;</TT> is a &quot;prompt&quot;. It's the computer's message
to you that it awaits your command. (We shall see that the same symbol
is also used inside commands to redirect output.) </P>

<P>First type the command into <I>Webterm</I> or into another terminal
window. This means placing your mouse in the window, activating the window
(possibly by clicking in it), and typing <TT>echo 'Hello!'</TT>. Press
the <I>Return</I> or <I>Enter</I> key to submit your command. Now try clicking
on the button. You should get the same results either way. [With the way
things are at the moment, if you click on a command button before you have
logged into the computer running Webterm, the buttons are deactivated forever.]
To make them work again, you will have to exit Netscape and restart the
entire tutorial. </P>

<P>Remember, you can always type the commands into Webterm or any other
window. While the buttons may eliminate some of the tedium, typing the
commands may help you learn them. Whether you decide to use the buttons
or not, you are strongly encouraged to experiment with the commands as
soon as you hear about them. Most Unix commands can be used in a wide variety
of ways, and this tutorial only discusses some of the simpler ones. There
is a &quot;Review Quiz&quot; near the end of most sections to help you
understand the material. </P>

<H3>Tutorial Files</H3>

<P>To get the expected results when you type in commands, you will need
to copy some tutorial files to some of your personal disk space on the
computer. To create the files the tutorial uses, press the button below
(or type the commands): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>&gt;<FONT SIZE=-1> cd ~</FONT></TT><FONT SIZE=-1> <BR>
<TT>&gt; cp -ir ~www/htdocs/tutorial/unix/tutorial-directories/* .</TT>
</FONT><APPLET codebase="bin" code="RegistryButton.class" 
     height=22 width=420><PARAM name="register" value="Unix Tutorial WebTerm"><PARAM name="label" value="cd ~; cp -i -r
    ~www/htdocs/tutorial/unix/tutorial-directories/* ."><PARAM name="command" value="send"><PARAM name="text" value="cd ~; cp -i -r
       ~www/htdocs/tutorial/unix/tutorial-directories/* .\r\n"></APPLET></P>
</UL>

<P>Remember to press the <I>return</I> key (and don't forget the period
. at the end of the command). If Unix responds with: </P>

<UL>
<P><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>overwrite <I>some-filename</I>?</FONT></TT><FONT SIZE=-1>
</FONT></P>
</UL>

<P>then you enter &quot;<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>n</FONT></TT>&quot;. If you enter
&quot;<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>y</FONT></TT>&quot;, your files may be damaged.
</P>

<H3>How Much do I Need to Know?</H3>

<P>If your goal is to &quot;just get started on the system&quot;, you only
need to complete the basic sections identified by <NOBR>the red car <IMG SRC="figs/CARGUY2.GIF" ALT="Basic" HEIGHT=75 WIDTH=120>.</NOBR>
The sections identified by <NOBR>the race car <IMG SRC="figs/RACECAR2.GIF" ALT="Specialized" HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=130>,</NOBR>
are somewaht more advanced or specialized (and more fun). You can complete
those sections now or wait until you have the need for them. Now that you
know how to use the tutorial, you are ready to learn <A HREF="access.html#top" ; onclick="top.frames[0].location='manage-access.html'">how
