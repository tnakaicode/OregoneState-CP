<p> All users of the Department Cluster must read, sign, and submit an
application form to a member of the Administrative Group.  There are
important procedures described on that application form which must be
followed.  

<p> You should also read the OSU 
<a target="Outside"
  href="http://www.ORST.EDU/dept/sst/one-pagers/acceptable_use.html">
Acceptable Use Policy</a>.  This document contains further conditions
and legal issues related to your computer accounts.


<p>
In particular: 
<ul>

<li> There is an obligation on the part of those using these
facilities and services to respect the intellectual and access rights
of others, locally, nationally and internationally.

<li> Computing resources and facilities of Oregon State University
shall be used for legitimate University instructional, research,
administrative, public service, or approved contract
purposes. Individuals who disregard elements of this policy will be
subject to appropriate disciplinary and/or legal action by Oregon
State University.


<li> These resources are to be used in an appropriate and legitimate
manner for the use authorized. Use of University computing facilities
for personal or commercial monetary gain must be consistent with state
statutes and Board of Higher Education Administrative Rules.


<li> Unless you have explicit permission, you have no business looking
into or modifying the files of other users or root. (An unlocked door
does not make tresspassing legal.)


<li> The electronic mail system shall not be used for "broadcasting"
of unsolicited mail. The communication system shall not be used for
sending of material that is likely to be considered obscene,
offensive, or threatening by the recipient of the material.


<li>
Much of the software and courseware we use is licensed or copyrighted. 
Individual users are legally responsible for adhering to the terms and
conditions under which such software and courseware were obtained and for
protecting the rights of developers.  Users agree not to make any copies of
licensed software or courseware.

<li> Feel free to use the Department Cluster for class work, but not
for email (we cannot afford the administrative overhead).  As a
general rule, a UCS or research account (where you can receive your
email) is required before we will give out Cluster accounts.  Please
don't send email to any Physics Cluster machine except
<code>graphy</code>.

</ul>
