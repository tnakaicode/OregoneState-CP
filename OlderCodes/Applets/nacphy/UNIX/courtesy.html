<p> When working on this workstation cluster, you should keep in mind
that file space and central memory are limited and shared with all
users. For this reason, please close unneeded windows and remove
unneeded files quickly. Also, keeping your array and file sizes from
becoming gigantic can help. Specifically, do <em>not</em> store all
your mail, news, executeable, postscript, object, or personal files on
the system. If you do need more space for your work, contact
<em>support</em>.

<p> When you are running programs or problem solving environments like
<em>Maple</em> on the Department Cluster, you are sharing CPU time,
disk access, and central memory with other users. If you have to wait
more than about 10-15 seconds for an answer, this means your job is
intensive enough to weight down the system for all users. This may be
unavoidable for complex problems. On the other hand, if your simple
problem appears to be running for too long, it's a good idea to
interrupt it  and enter it again, carefully. Sometimes a typing
error or an extra zero can change the problem significantly.

<p> One way to be considerate of other users, is to have you time- or
memory-intensive programs run when the demand on the system is low
(like overnight and on weekends).  This can be done with the
<em>nice, batch,</em> and <em>at</em> commands.  (The
<em>nice</em> command will be described in the
<em>programming</em> section, or the <code>man nice</code> command
will give you the information on it.)  Another way to
be considerate is to work on the least-used machine at the time. The
<em>rwho, users,</em> and <em>ruptime</em> commands will show you where
the users are and what the load is.


<p> Do not run your own widow managers or change the setup files on
the x-stations as you might on your personal computer or research
computer.  Our cluster is a finely-tuned system and user changes to it
can be harmful to others.

<p><em>Beware,</em> you should not assume that your files are backed
up by the authories or will remain on the computer until you tell
someone to get rid of them. While we try to notify you in advance, or
wait until you leave the department, you should be prepared to have
all your files disappear without notice. It also means <em>you</em>
personally should have some means to restore them, possibly from
floppy disks or from your <em>ucs</em> account.
