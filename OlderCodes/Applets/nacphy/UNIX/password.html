<h2><center>&#167 2.B: Changing Your Password</center></h2>
<hr>

<p> It it fairly standard, the first time you log onto a Unix system,
to be asked to change your password.

<p> Before picking a password, it is important to consider security.
A good password is easy for you to remember and hard for someone else
to guess.  Here is some good advice from 
<EM>  A Scientist's and Engineer's Guide to Workstations and
Supercomputers</EM> (an excellent paper-based book for scientists and
engineers, which, incidently, was written by one of the directors of
this project): 

<ul>"since the password protects your work and
the entire system from unauthorized and careless users, and since it
is relatively easy for other users (all throughout the networked world
no less!) to move through Unix systems, you should carefully guard
your password."
</ul>

  Passwords should be at least five characters long.  They
can be up to eight characters long, including numbers and special
characters.  Using eight characters makes your password more secure.
Try not to use a word in a dictonary or a proper noun because they are
so easy to guess just by going through the dictonary.  Personal
information, like your social security number, phone number or
birthday is also easy to guess (as you know from all those spy movies
you have been seeing).  In particular, do not use your username.  Mix
letters, numbers, and punctuation.  Mix lower and upper case letters,
too.  

<p>
A good way of getting a secure password is to think of a phrase
and then take the initial letters of the words in the phrase, randomly
capitalizing and adding punctuation.  License plate combinations like
<code>10sne1</code> also work well.  Keep several passwords in mind,
so you can change your password regularly (every few months or any
time you think someone else knows it).


<p> Keep in mind that your password is your own.  No one else should
know it.  Do not share your account with other users by giving your
password to them.  Depending on the conditions under which your
account was given to you, sharing it may be like sharing your driver's
license, it is often grounds for revocation.  Please do not do it.


<p> Keep your password secure.  Do not keep it in a computer file
or send it by email. 


<p> 
If you wish to change your password, issue the command:

<ul>
<code>> passwd</code>  
  <applet codebase="bin" code="RegistryButton.class" 
     height=22 width=60>
      <param name="register" value="Unix Tutorial WebTerm">
  <param name="label" value="passwd">
    <param name="command" value="send">
     <param name="text" value="passwd\r\n">
  </applet>
</ul>


<p> followed by the <em>return</em> key.  (Remember, the
<code>></code> is the computer's prompt, and it may be different on
your system.) If your password has expired, Unix may automatically
start this command for you.  Either way, you will be prompted first
for your old password and then for your new password.  In fact, you
will be prompted several times to enter your new password just to make
sure you and Unix got it right.


<p> Be sure to notice if the <em>Num Lock</em> or <em>Caps Lock</em>
key has been activated.  Unix is case-sensitive, so while both are
acceptable, "10sne1" is not the same as "10SNE1".


<p> Ask your system administrator for help when you forget your
password.
