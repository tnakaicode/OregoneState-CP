<dl><dt><b>DEC Alpha's</b>
<dd>The machine goophy is a DEC Alpha 3000/500 with
64MB of RAM and two 1 GB hard drives. 
There is also a 9 GB disk
attached to a SCSI port. The machine daphy is a DEC 200 4/166 also
with 64MB of RAM, two 1 GB drives and 9 GB disk.  Both machines run OSF/1 3.0,
have about 384 MB of swap space, 3D graphics hardware, and
sound.  <code>goophy</code> has a CD drive and a tape drive. <code>daphy</code> has a
floppy drive which can read and write DOS. 
<dt><b>IBM RS/6000's</b>
<dd>
Graphy is an IBM RS/6000 320 with 32 MB RAM and some 1.5 GB of
hard disk space. Graphy has a CD drive,
and a floppy drive which can read and write DOS. 
<dd>
Banana, coconut, guava, mago, papaya are PowerPC IBM RS6000 with 32 MB of RAM,
a 1 GB hard drive, a CD drive, a floppy drive which can read and write DOS 
and about 100 MB of swap space.
Hermes is a similar machine with two 1 GB hard drives.
