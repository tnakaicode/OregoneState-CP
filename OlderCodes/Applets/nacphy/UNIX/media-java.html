<center><h2>&#167 23.F:&nbsp; ; Internet Programming Tools </h2></center>
<hr>

<P>For the ultimate in interactivity and control, nothing can beat writing
your own program. The finest control can be found with programs written
in standard programming languages such as C and Fortran. Many popular CD
ROM titles are done this way. This level of sophistication is usually achieved
by teams of experts (artists, programmers, writers and content experts).
However, by using the internet and CGI-scripts or the Java programming
language, we can obtain some of this control without nearly the level of
expertise or manpower. </P>

<P><I>Scripts</I> are simple programs which allow basic interactivity.
A Web page is created which includes instructions for the user to enter
information or select from a list. The user then &quot;submits&quot; the
information and a short program (script) is run which creates a new Web
page based on the information the user entered. If you have used one of
the popular search engines, you have probably used a script. Because there
are few limits on the type of operations a script can execute, most systems
(the OSU Physics Cluster included) keep scripts in a protected directory
which most users are not allowed to modify. Because of this restriction,
we will stop our discussion of CGI-scripts here. If you become interested
in CGI-scripts, you can find instructions and examples of almost any kind
of script you might want on the internet, and you can ask the system administrator
to allow you limited access to the CGI area. </P>

<P>Java is a programming environment designed specifically for the internet.
It is relatively secure, so you can keep your programs in your own directory.
Java, like C and Fortran, is a full-fledged programming language, and we
will not make an effort to teach you how to program in it. However, a few
quick notes about the nature of Java are in order. </P>

<P>Java is object oriented. This means that Java is intended to work best
within a specific type of structure. If you do not know object oriented
programming and you intend to do any complex Java programs, it is worthwhile
to learn about object oriented programming (see <I>Computational Physics
</I>by Landau and Paez).</P>

<P>Java is a secure language when run as an applet through a Web browser,
but also exists as a stand alone language. This means that you may read
about a specific Java command which you cannot use in your applet due to
security restrictions. Most Java books contain a general list of applet
security restrictions. </P>

<P>Java has been loaded on the OSU Physics cluster. If you are working
on a machine which does not have Java, you can <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk" target="Outside">download</A>
it from Sun. </P>

<P>. For instance, We have included the program <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>GraphApplet.java</FONT></TT>
in the <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Java</FONT></TT> directory of your tutorial files.
(This is one of the many sample programs which come with Java.) Change
directories to Java and try compiling it with the &quot;java compile&quot;
command <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>javac: </FONT></TT></P>

<UL>
<P><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&gt; cd Java</FONT></TT> </P>

<P><TT>&gt;<FONT SIZE=-1> javac GraphApplet.java</FONT></TT><FONT SIZE=-1>
</FONT></P>
</UL>

<P>After some time, the Java compiler will give you a new prompt signaling
that it is done compiling and found no errors. If you do an <I>ls</I>,
you will find that there is a new file <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>GraphApplet.class</FONT></TT>.
This is your compiled program. </P>

<P>There are two ways to run your Java applet. For testing, you will generally
want to use the applet viewer (certain code, for example WebTerm, which
involves socket connections or other low-level communications features
may not run on the applet viewer). The other method is to use your Web
browser. For either method you will need an <FONT SIZE=-1><I>HTML</I> </FONT>file
to start the applet. The file <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>example1.html</FONT></TT>
has been provided for this purpose:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&gt; more example1.htm</FONT>l</TT> </p>
</UL>

<P>Pay particular attention to the command </P>

<UL>
<PRE><TT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>&lt;applet code=GraphApplet.class width=300 height=120&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;</FONT></TT>
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>This tells the browser to load the <I>applet</I> <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>GraphApplet.class</FONT></TT>
in a box of size <FONT SIZE=-1><TT>width=300 height=120</TT>.</FONT> Any
time you wish to use a Java applet, you will need to include an <I>applet</I>
tag like the one above in your <TT>HTML</TT>. </P>

<P>If you are working on an Xstation, try running your code on the applet
viewer. Go to your window (not WebTerm) and enter the command </P>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1><TT>&gt; appletviewer example1.html</TT> </FONT></P>
</UL>

<P>A somewhat boring example. Now try opening the file with your browser.
If you are using <I>Netscape,</I> use the &quot;Open&quot; command under
&quot;File&quot;, then select the directory &quot;Java&quot; and press
&quot;Filter&quot;. Then select the file <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;example1.htm</FONT></TT>l&quot;
and press &quot;<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>OK&quot;.</FONT></TT> </P>

<P>Obviously, you will want to make more exciting programs to include on
your Web pages. For advice on how to write simple programs in Java, we
recommend the many examples available on the Web. For information on how
to design more complex examples, we recommend a course or book which includes
information on object oriented program design. If you are already an expert
C++ programmer, you may find the book <I><A HREF="http://www.ora.com/catalog/javanut2/desc.html" target="Outside">Java
in a Nutshell</A></I> by David Flanagan a useful and affordable reference.
