<hr>

<p> Your best bet is to do your work on whichever machine has the
fewest users or jobs to do. (The exception being <em>hermes</em>
which is reserved for Web serving and should not be used for direct
computations.)  Yet you must log on to some machine before you can
determine the workload on the cluster (we describe how to do that
soon). An open console is a good machine to start with, or use an
X station to a machine which  does not get much use.

<p> In the Department Cluster, the DEC's are somewhat faster machines
than the IBM's and they may seem like the best choice. But remember
that two users on a "fast" machine is probably slower than one user on
a "slow" machine (the fast machines are hardly ever twice as fast at
complete calculations). At present, the DEC's have the additional
workload of maintaining the file system and are popular because they
have been around longer, so they may be faster, but also slower for
you to get your work done on. 

<p> However, if you need more than the 32 MB of RAM that are on the
IBM's, then the DEC's with 64 MB would be preferred. (If you need more
than 64 MB, you should look for a research computer because your job
will need virtual memory and that is slow.)

<p> Once you are logged onto a machine, you can determine the other
users on that machine with the <em>users</em> command:

<ul>
<code>> users</code>  
  <applet codebase="bin" code="RegistryButton.class" 
     height=22 width=45>
      <param name="register" value="Unix Tutorial WebTerm">
	<param name="label" value="users">
	  <param name="command" value="send">
	   <param name="text" value="users\r\n">
  </applet>
</ul>

Go ahead and try it now. 

<p> You can find out about users on the machines goophy and banana by
executing <em>users</em> as a remote shell (<em>rsh</em>)
command:

<ul>
<code>> rsh goophy users</code><br>
<code>> rsh banana users</code><br>
</ul>

Another option is to try the remote <em>who</em> command which
goes snooping all over the cluster:

<ul>
<code>> rwho</code>
</ul>

<p>Now this is a little fancy, but if you really want to see all the
processes on a machine, use the processes (<em>ps</em>) command:

<ul> 
<code>> ps -ef|grep -v root</code>
</ul>

<p> Here we have used a <code>|</code> to "pipe" the output of
<em>ps</em> through the <em>grep</em> command to remove ("veto") all 
processes being run by root.

<p> Because machine speed is dependent on workload, which machine is
fastest may depend on the time of day (the familiar afternoon
brownout).  Keep in mind that even  though you are
 logged on to one machine, you can easily open a window to another
and do your work on it. (Try clicking the different mouse buttons in
