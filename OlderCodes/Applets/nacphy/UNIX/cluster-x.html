<center><h2>&#167 3.B:What About X Stations?</h2></center>
<hr>

<p> When you sit down at a Unix computer, you may be facing a
"console" which is connected directly into a computer's central
processing unit, or a terminal connected over a network.  It is likely
that both can run the X Window System. A terminal engineered to run
the X Window System remotely is called an <em>X terminal</em> or an <em>X
station.</em> While these terminals contain rather substantial
computing power themselves, they are still terminals in that they
cannot function without the central workstation providing the terminal
with operating system, programs, memory, and CPU cycles.

<p> It might be hard to tell at first if you are seated at a console
or an X station. If the screen in front of you requests a password,
then you probably are at a console of a Unix machine.  After you enter
your userid and password, the X Window System begins.


<p> If the screen in front of you contains a list of computer names
("hosts") or a whole bunch of windows, it's probably an X
station. (Yet you can't be sure about that because some X stations may
be set up to connect to only one computer. In that case you may need
look at the physical characteristics, like lack of floppy drive, for
clues.)


<p> The X stations in our Departmental Cluster run the <em>XDM</em>
station manager. This manager presents you with two host selection
windows. Double clicking on a host in the <em>larger</em> or "Telnet"
window will set up a <em>telnet</em> session.  While a <em>telnet</em>
session is not good for things graphical, it is probably the most
reliable and fastest connection to other computers. It is ideal for
reading mail and for connecting outside the Department, and is not as
much of a load on the system as the X Window System.  (Telnet is also
useful if you've messed up your dotfiles and can't start an X
session.)

<p> Double clicking on a host name in the <em>smaller</em> or "Manage"
window, which often gets hidden behind the larger one, starts a
complete X session. This is what you usually want to do with an X
station.  Don't bother clicking on host name for machines on which you
don't have accounts.  You won't be able to get in.

<p> Unix machines should go through a rather involved process before
they are shut off.  If your console or X station locks up and you are
unable to unlock it from the keyboard, get help.  If no help is
available, then log onto another machine and send  support 
email stating what happened on what machine.  <b>Never Turn The Power
Off To A Unix Computer</b>. That is the job for the system
administrator only. (An X station can have its power turned off and
then <em>slowly</em> turned back on. This should unlock it, but may
take several minutes and does load down the system.)
