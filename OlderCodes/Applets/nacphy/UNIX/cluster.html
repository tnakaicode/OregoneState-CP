<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>&sect; 3: Using a Workstation Cluster </H2>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>The Departmental computer cluster is a group of Unix workstations and
X stations. You use your same userid and password to log on to any of them.
You may logon through the console of a workstation (probably the fastest
way to run) or through one of the X stations. Once logged onto one computer,
you can then log onto others using the same windowing session. At present
the Departmental workstations include: </P>

<P>IBM RS/6000's (the &quot;fruit loop&quot; and friends, 32M RAM, AIX
Unix): </P>

<PRE>      <FONT SIZE=-1>banana.physics.orst.edu 
        coconut.physics.orst.edu 
        guava.physics.orst.edu 
        mango.physics.orst.edu
        papaya.physics.orst.edu
        graphy.physics.orst.edu
        hermes.physics.orst.edu</FONT>
</PRE>

<P>DEC Alpha's (64M RAM, OSF Unix): </P>

<PRE>      <FONT SIZE=-1>daphy.physics.orst.edu
        goophy.physics.orst.edu</FONT></PRE>

<P>Usually these machines are called by their nicknames. For example, <TT>banana</TT>
is all you need to use for an address within the cluster, with the full
address used for networked communications. If you are curious, there is
some <A HREF="stats.html#top">detailed information</A> about the machines.
</P>

<P>All computers in the cluster use a common file space for users such
as yourself. <I>This means that you work with the same file regardless
of the machine you are on.</I> This is a good thing as it allows you to
switch from one machine, which may have a high workload, to another which
is just sitting around. If you compile or interpret your programs (as happens
when you run <I>f77, f90, cc, Maple, Mathematica</I>, or <I>Xmgr</I>) you
should get essentially the same environment and results regardless of the
machine. If you stay within the machines of one manufacturer (and therefore
architecture), you can even run the same executeable (object code) on different
machines. If you try to run an executable program on the wrong architecture,
you should get an error message (unless you are unlucky). </P>

<P>In order for each machine in the Cluster to run just right for you,
it must have <I>dotfiles</I> which are appropriate for the operating system
and windowing system on that particular machine (you will learn more about
these later). In the present case, this means you need different dotfiles
for the IBM's and for the DEC's. </P>

<P>Usually when a user gets a new account on the Cluster, a bunch of standard
dotfiles are automatically placed in the user's file space (&quot;home
directory&quot;). These dotfiles let you log on from consoles and X Stations
of different manufactures and designs. Normally, these dotfiles do their
job with no interference on your part, and it's best not to interfere with
them. </P>

<P>Some users feel inclined to modify their dotfiles in order to obtain
that &quot;custom look&quot;. We suggest you avoid that urge for individuality
until you really know what you are doing. If you feel you &quot;must&quot;,
then keep a backup copy of the original files. Changes that may seem harmless
may prevent you logging in again! In our Departmental Cluster, you can
get back the standard dotfiles by telneting onto <I>goophy</I> and issuing
the command </P>
