<h2>To Use this Sample Page</h2>

Make sure your home directory and the
public_html directory have public read protections, as well 
as the file <b>index.html</b>.  Using your favorite text editor,
modify this document to suit your situation.  To learn more about html,
select the ``about html'' item under the <b>Help</b> menu.
You can attach pictures, link to other pages, whatever.
<p>
A good way to learn is to look at other peoples pages.
When you see something you like, select ``view source'' from
the <b>File</b> memu and see how they've done it.  Then copy.
<p>
If you want to get fancy you can try pictures or graphics.  There
are many sources of clip art on the net.
You can also borrow the quick-shot from the CS 108 lab to try
taking a picture of yourself.  You need to then run photoshop or
some other utility on the mac to convert the image into GIF or JPEG
format.  Ask around -- lots of people will be willing to help.
