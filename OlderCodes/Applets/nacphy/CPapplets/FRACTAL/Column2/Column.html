      <h2>Correlated Ballistic Deposition</h2>
       This is an application of random numbers. Simulated the deposition
        of particles in column growth. Is similar to simple Ballistic Deposition but
        the difference is that  the last particle attached to the column
        attacts the new generated particle and the probability that the particle sticks to it,
        is proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance between the two.(The 
        probability is low it is far ).
