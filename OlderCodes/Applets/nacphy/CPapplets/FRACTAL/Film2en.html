     <h3>Instructions</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Once you obtain all the points press "continue" so that
             the box counting begins; the boxes which contains parts of
             the surface will be counted.
         <li>Continue pressing the button four more times, the scale
             increases and also the box number.
         <li> Press "start" to obtain a new ballistic deposition.
        </ul>
       <h2> Ballistic Deposition</h2>
        This model was proposed to simulate sedimentations of hydrocarbon
        small spheres. 
In this application we use a sustrate of 200 units long in which particles
are going to be deposited forming columns; random numbers are used to
simulate the place where the generated particle will be deposited according
to simple rules.
<p>
For details of the calculation see the book by Landau and Páez <a
href="libro.html">"Computational Physics" </a> , Wiley and  Sons Inc. 1997.

The interesting aspect of this application is that the surface is a fractal
and the fractal dimension is determined with the box counting technique,
which consists in:
<ul>
   <li> An scale <i>s</s> is chosen  and the number <i> N</i> of squares
that contain surface points are counted.
  <li>Here we begin with an scale 1:3, that is <i> s</i> =3,
  <li> Next we take a bigger scale 1:6, then <i>s</i> = 6, and again the
squares (N) are counted, a graph of <b>log(N)</b> versus <b> log(s)</b>.
  <li> We continue duplicating the scale, count the squares number (N) and
plot them in the graph, and finally the slope: 

 <li> <u>  log(N1) -log(N2)</u> <br>
             log(s2)-log(s1) <br>         
                 
<li> gives the fractal dimension.
</ul>
