<h2>
Diffusion Limited Agregation</h2>

<p><br>One or several particles are randomly generated in the circumference,
and they take random gaussian walks (their lengths&nbsp; are also randomly
produced) in each step the direction (up, down, right or left) is selected
at random.&nbsp; If a particle hits one of the fixed particles inside the
circle it sticks. When the walk end and the particle does not hit another
one, it disappears and new ones are produced. The particles&nbsp; that
go out the circle are eliminated.
<br>This model is used to simulated dendrite formation, electrolitic deposition
and other phenomena.

<p><b>Instructions</b>
<p><b>Start:</b> Begins the simulation
<br><b>Pause: </b>Makes a pause in the simulation
<br><b>Stop:</b> Stops the simulation
<br><b>Reset:</b>Erases the particles inside the circle.
<br><b>Num +:</b> Increases the number of particles generated on the circumference
<br><b>Num -:</b> Decreases the number of particles generated on the circumference
<br>The number of generated particles is in the box

<br>To select several "seed" particles, click inside the circle.
