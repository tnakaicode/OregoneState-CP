<h2>What are  Pendulum
Applets?</h2>

Applets are Java's little application programs that are transferred
over the Web to run on your local computer.  Our applets solve
the equation of motion of the pendulum numerically, display the results 
in various ways, and
lets you interact with the program. There is a separate control window
with buttons and slide bars to adjust the parameters and to control the
animation.

<P>
<em>Warning:</em> the behavior of a chaotic system can be
hypersensitive to the precise values of its parameters and initial
conditions; even small changes can make big differences. For
this reason we also list a number of parameter choices that give
interesting behaviors; just double click on them to run the applet
with these parameters. Then go experiment!
