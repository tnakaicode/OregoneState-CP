  <h2>Suggested Explorations </h2>
<ol>
<li> Try out all the tabulated cases and describe what's happening.

<li> Compare the motion of the two almost-identical pendula, and pick
out a particular point where the coordinate space motions begin to
differ.

<li> Compare the motion of the two almost-identical pendula, and note
in which way the phase-space motion of the two pendula appear similar even
though the coordinate space motions differ.

<li> Turn off the frictional and driving torques and identify the
phase-space figures which correspond to the natural oscillations of
the system.

<li> Describe how the phase-space shapes of the natural oscillations
change as the initial velocity is made greater and greater.


<li> Turn off the driving torque, but not friction, and describe the
shape of the
phase-space figures.

<li>Identify which physical motions of the pendulum lead to 
particular shapes in phase space.

<LI>In what direction (clockwise or counter clockwise)
does the pendulum travel in phase space?

<li>What happens in phase space when the pendulum goes "over the top"
in coordinate space?

<li>How can you tell in phase space if the pendulum is swinging
clockwise or counter clockwise in coordinate space?

<li>Identify which parts of the orbit are <em>transients</em> and
which parts are <em>attractors.</em>

<li> Try to find a <em>limit cycle</em> in which the average energy
put into the system during one cycle exactly balances the average
energy dissipated by friction during that cycle.

<li> Make the driving torque so large that it overpowers the natural
oscillations of the pendulum and the steady-state motion is at the
frequency of the driver. This is an example of <em>mode locking.</em>

<li> Sweep the driver's frequency through the pendulum's natural
frequency and find <em>resonances.</em>

<li> Turn off friction and again sweep the driver's frequency through
the pendulum's natural frequency and find <em>resonances.</em>

<li> Look for resonances which also occur when the ratio of driver's
frequency to natural frequency is the ratio of integers.
